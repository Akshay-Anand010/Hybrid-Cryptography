## Abstract
This  paper  mainly focusses   on   the   implementation   of   a   system   capable   of encryption  and  decryption  of  multimedia  data  (Text,  Images, Videos,  Audio  etc.)  using  a  hybrid  model  based  on  the amalgamation  of  symmetric  encryption  techniques  such  as AES and  asymmetric  techniques  such  as  ECC.
