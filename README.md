# Hybrid-Cryptography

#### This repository contains an implemntaion of this [Paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/496c/3aa8c731e93deac7a5ad3b1fbd4dd264b11a.pdf)

## Abstract
This  paper  mainly focusses   on   the   implementation   of   a   system   capable   of encryption  and  decryption  of  multimedia  data  (Text,  Images, Videos,  Audio  etc.)  using  a  hybrid  model  based  on  the amalgamation  of  symmetric  encryption  techniques  such  as AES and  asymmetric  techniques  such  as  ECC.

## Implementation
The encryption process occurs as follows, and the decryption process is the reverse of the same.

## Enigma
This is an apllication made using Django and NodeJs, that is bases on encryption and decryption process mentioned in the paper.

Run the Enigma application in virtual environment and also run the node-js server
